# ðŸš— ParkNGo â€“ First UI/UX Prototype

**ParkNGo** is my first UI/UX prototype, designed using **Figma** as part of my participation in a workshop organized by **TEKnology**. The idea was originally inspired by a project I worked on for the **Principals Software Engineering Principles** course at university.
